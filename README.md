 This repository will include Postgresql queries for COVID Vaccine . tables used were country_vaccinations and country_vac_manuf.
 The two tables were downloaded from Kaggle as CSV file. I have included different queries for comparison from two tables.
The purpose was to show vaccination used by countries and vaccination manufactured by countries . also cleaned data to remove null values
